# Cleopatra manuscript analysis code

This repository contains analysis scripts and notebooks associated with the Cleopatra manuscript.  
For the Cleopatra model code, see the [Cleopatra](https://github.com/liu-bioinfo-lab/Cleopatra/) repository.  
For code associated with the loop caller CHIRON, see the [CHIRON](https://github.com/ahansenlab/chiron) repository.  

The repository is divided into folders corresponding to different sections of the manuscript. A more detailed README can be found in each folder. Example data and RCMC loops can be found in the **useful_data** folder to run the analyses in the various folders. 

1. **microc_pipeline**: Scripts for aligning Micro-C data
2. **rcmc_pipeline**: Scripts for aligning RCMC data
3. **contact_map_quality_comparisons**: Comparing RCMC contact maps with either Hi-C or Micro-C
4. **boundary_analyses**: Analysis of fine-scale boundaries in RCMC data
5. **loop_analyses**: All loop related analyses for both RCMC and Cleopatra
6. **cleopatra_analyses**: Scripts associated with converting Cleopatra imputations to coolers and benchmarking
